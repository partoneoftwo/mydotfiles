This is are my .config files


.zshrc - info

I found these settings by talking to verth on Reddit. When I asked him
about tips on how to create a cool zsh config file, he responded with
this:

oof, that's a difficult question to answer :) Here's a link to mine.
I've tried to comment for explanation. I've been using zsh for 3 years
so it's got a lot of stuff I've added, no doubt. Start with the setopt
stuff at the bottom; that's where a lot of the magic of zsh comes into
play.

I also recommend setting ssh_config to not hash known hosts, delete
your known hosts file, and add all the stuff in the "completion"
section in the middle. That's where pretty much the rest of my zsh
love comes into play. Tab completion is so powerful, and that section
in my .zshrc hasn't been changed in a while, so it's robust.

The top of my .zshrc contains a lot of oh-my-zsh configuration, which
many zsh users frown upon. It's been an integral part of my setup
since day one, and I love it, so your miles may vary. It includes a
lot of preconfigured plugin functions and completions for typical
programs, so I like it a lot.

That said, it's another framework, which has zealots and opponents,
both sides with valid points. YMMV. There's other zsh config
frameworks, so it might be worth your time to look into those.
Thankfully, all I've seen don't take much time to set up.

Here is a link to my delicious bookmarks tagged 'zsh' There's a lot of
gems in here, too. Happy hacking!
